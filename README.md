# KotlinCalculator-For this app as you can see I turned it in rather late. I was able to make a completely functioning calculator it took me longer
than expected and also gave me more troubles than I expected to have. The begining steps of creating the UI interface in XML was actually quite easy
I believe I was able to satisfy all requirements. One major problem is I tried to stretch myself and use styles to help simplify the amount of code I 
had to write in XML. This also then lead me to run try and use Kotlin Android Extensions however, I ran into multiple errors and found that it had been 
deprecated in the past year or two and had moved onto Jetpack view binding. Jetpack view binding was a little tricky to implement because it was a large
jump in my knowledge of android studios and kotlin but I was able to make it work (after reading much documentation). Once I got two my kotlin
calculation section I wanted it to be able to handle all cases and by doing this I lead myself into a new rabbit hole. This lead me to watching many 
tutorial videos and stack overflow answers but I was able to make it work correctly. I can't vouch for the kotlin programming as my own because alot of it
was copied from stack overflow and multiple tutorial videos. But in all a big learning moment for me.
